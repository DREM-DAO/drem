„The biggest issue of real value assets was their liquidity “
Investors from around the world were limited in terms of investing into reals assets as they would usually need to buy whole projects and houses which costs millions. 
“Real value assets always faced scrutiny in traditional markets especially with low liquidity and tradability because of inelastic market, high face values of transactions and high costs for issuers and investors alike for trading.”
DREM is here with the help of decentralized market to overcome these obstacles. 
DREM converts real estate assets into dividable NFTs sum of which representing 1 unity of NFT (house, bond issue, Loan). These NFTs yield continual interest rate from rents which is then paid to investors alongside down payments for projects.  This makes investments more accessible to medium-sized small-scale investors.
It decreases risk of over investing into single Asset .  Even more comforting is that medium and small-scale income investors can finally diversify their savings into multiple projects and decrease their overall risk of project default and choose acceptable risk investment strategy with predefined risk profile, which was not available in traditional markets.
Dividing Asset into smaller token also enables to trade Asset on decentralized Exchange as with multiple units of single Asset we can have more liquid Asset market as market makers face much less risk and are able to provide lower spreads and better liquidity.
